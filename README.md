# GitHub-Practice
Place for learning how to use GitHub

Hello Everyone.

I'm Willis. I feel that my lessons in life have taught me that life is meant to be enjoyed,
not understood; and that we should seek to explore our full potentional as human beings. I
enjoy law, philosophy, psychology, and anything to do with electronics and computers. Moreover,
I have a lot of wisdom to share with the world, and can not think of a better way to do this
than with computers / technology. Therefore, I've been working on learning web desing and
programming to help me to continue to learn knew things and push the boundries of my mental
and creative capabilities, while at the same time teaching me the tools and skills that I
need to be able to share my thought, ideas, and experiencs with the world. GitHub is a part
of this journer, so here I am.
